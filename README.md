## Motivat
  - In the past I had faced with alot of problem with code *ON IN ONE* push all of things to activities, fragments or presenters 
and after some releases then productivity went down because of hard to changes, maintenance, extends,...
so that why I try to investigate and apply clean architecture, clean code
  - Article make me interest with cryptocoin: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/today-i-launched-my-first-mobile-app-heres-what-i-learned-6fc25c14eee6

## Introducttion
 - In this project I try to implement clean architecture, clean code to see the real code look like.
 - To know how can dagger connect domain layer with data layer
 - Handling background with RxJava
 - Error handling
 - Synchronize and cache data with Room db
 - Some funny with cryptocoin, you can find here:

## Purpose of Clean Architectture - Clean Code
  - Effort is minimized, productivity and functionaly and flexibility are maximinzed
  - Readable
  - Maintainable
  - Scalable
  - Extendable
  - Testable
